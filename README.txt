This is a tool that I made to help me format my blog posts.
If you use the provided css file, you can make articles that look fairly professional.
You'll need to personalize the html template yourself with the elements that you want shared between all of your pages.
I plan to add support for images, but so far this has just been a weekend project.

Instructions:
1.Use the following tags to define your formatting
2.Paste your annotated plaintext into input.txt
3.Run static_gen_html.txt


Tag list:
	Text blocks:
		*t ... *	title
		*h ... *	header
		*p ... *	paragraph
		*bib ... *	bibliography

	Font styles:
		&b ... &	bold
		&i ... &	italic
