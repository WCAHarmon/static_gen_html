This is a tool that I made to help me format my blog posts.
If you use the provided css file, you can make articles that look fairly professional.
I plan to add support for images, but so far this has just been a weekend project.

Instructions:
1.Use the following tags to define your formatting
2.Paste your annotated plaintext into input.txt
3.Run static_gen_html.txt


Tag list:
	Text blocks:
		*t ... *	title
		*h ... *	header
		*p ... *	paragraph
		*bib ... *	bibliography

	Font styles:
		&b ... &	bold
		&i ... &	italic
